# Weather-Analysis

# This is a Hadoop MapReduce project to compute average temperature, windspeed and dew point of Texas state

# Input consists of station_id, yearmonthday, temperature, windspeed, dewpoint and so on

# Two MapReduce jobs are needed

# Every hour is monitored in the input file, therefore the average is computed for each day of each station of each year and each month

# Similarly the average can be computed for month, year based on the needs
